            <p>
                The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the change in the price of goods and services from the perspective of the consumer. It is a key way to measure changes in purchasing trends and inflation

                A higher than expected reading should be taken as positive/ bullish for the USD, while a lower than expected reading should be taken as negative/bearish for the USD. Strong dollar implies that gold should go down but only mentally challenged traders would make these conclusions.

                Gold responds to two things, monetary policy and inflation. Now these two goes hand in hand together because monetary policy decisions are made on the basis of the overall health of the economy and inflation is a very good indicator about price pressure. The higher the prices the greater the pressure is.Every Central Bank in the world has 2 key goals or objectives,Low and predictable levels of inflation and maximum employment.This is what economist calls the FEDs DUAL MANDATE. Low and predictable inflation brings us price stability
